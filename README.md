# Bad-Editor
A very bad editor where you have to type everything in binary.

## Compiling
This program comsists of just one file, so all you have to do is compile BadEditor.cpp.

`g++ -o BadEditor BadEditor.cpp`

## Usage
It's very simple. Type the file name and then the binary. Below is an example of my failed attempt at creating a simple program in c++.
